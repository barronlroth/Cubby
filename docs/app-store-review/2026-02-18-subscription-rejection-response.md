## Paste-ready App Review note

Hello App Review team,

Thank you for the feedback. We addressed both issues from the February 18, 2026 review:

1) Guideline 3.1.2 (Subscriptions)
- We updated the in-app paywall to include required subscription information and legal links directly in the purchase flow:
  - Terms of Use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/
  - Privacy Policy: https://alfred.barronroth.com/cubby/privacy

2) Guideline 2.3.2 (Accurate Metadata)
- We updated the App Description to clearly indicate which features are free and which require Cubby Pro subscription.
- We also ensured the Terms of Use link is present in the description and the Privacy Policy URL is populated in App Store Connect.

Please re-review the submission. Thank you.
