# Tags Feature - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
Tags provide a flexible way for users to categorize and organize their inventory items with custom labels, enabling more powerful search and organization capabilities.

## User Story
As a homeowner, I want to tag my items with descriptive keywords so that I can quickly find related items through search, making it easier to locate and organize my belongings.

## Core Requirements

### Tag Creation & Management
- Users can add tags directly from the item detail page
- Tags are created on-the-fly as users type
- No centralized tag management screen in v1
- Maximum of 10 tags per item

### Tag Input Behavior
- **Autocomplete**: As users type, existing tags are suggested for consistency
- **Format enforcement**: 
  - All tags automatically converted to lowercase
  - Spaces automatically converted to dashes (-)
  - No special characters except dashes
  - Example: "Home Office" becomes "home-office"

### Tag Display
- **Location**: Item detail page only (not visible on home screen in v1)
- **Visual style**: Displayed as chips/pills for easy scanning
- **Editing**: Users can remove tags by tapping an 'x' on each chip
- **Order**: Tags displayed alphabetically for consistency

### Search Integration
- **Unified search**: Tags are searchable through the existing search bar
- **Search scope**: Single search query searches across:
  - Item titles
  - Item descriptions  
  - Item tags
- **Partial matching**: Searching "tech" returns items tagged with:
  - "tech"
  - "technology"
  - "high-tech"
  - Any tag containing "tech"
- **Multi-tag search**: Users can search for multiple tags
  - Example: "tech kitchen" finds items with either tag
  - Results ranked by relevance (items matching both tags appear first)

### User Experience Flow

#### Adding Tags
1. User navigates to item detail page (or item creation screen)
2. User taps "Add tag" button/field
3. User types tag name
4. Autocomplete suggests existing matching tags
5. User selects suggestion or continues typing
6. Space key automatically converts to dash
7. User presses Enter/Return to save tag
8. Tag appears as chip with other tags
9. Input field clears and remains focused for quick entry of next tag
10. User can continue adding tags or tap outside to finish

#### Removing Tags
1. User navigates to item detail page
2. User taps 'x' on tag chip
3. Tag is immediately removed from item

#### Searching with Tags
1. User enters search term in main search bar
2. Results include items where search term matches:
   - Any part of item title
   - Any part of item description
   - Any part of any tag
3. Results update in real-time (with debouncing)

## Success Metrics
- Users add tags to at least 30% of their items
- Search queries that match tags have higher engagement
- Reduced time to find items

## Out of Scope for v1
- Bulk tag operations (applying tags to multiple items)
- Tag management screen (viewing all tags, renaming, merging)
- Tag-based filtering (showing only items with specific tags)
- Tag colors or icons
- Tag categories or hierarchies
- Suggested/preset tags
- Tag usage analytics
- Tags visible on home screen

## Future Considerations (v2+)
- Display tags on home screen item rows
- Dedicated tag management interface
- Bulk tagging operations
- Smart tag suggestions based on item title/description
- Tag-based collections or smart folders
- Tag sharing between household members
- Visual tag customization (colors, icons)

## Edge Cases & Constraints
- **Duplicate tags**: Prevent same tag being added twice to an item
- **Empty tags**: Disallow empty or whitespace-only tags
- **Tag length**: Minimum 1 character, maximum 30 characters
- **Performance**: Search performance with many tags per item
- **Data migration**: Existing items start with no tags
