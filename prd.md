# Product Requirements Document: Home Inventory App

## Executive Summary

A mobile application designed to help users catalog and track their belongings across multiple homes, solving the common problem of forgetting where items are stored and preventing duplicate purchases.

## Problem Statement

Users often purchase items, store them away, forget their location, and end up buying duplicates. This leads to wasted money and cluttered spaces. There's a need for a simple, visual system to track what you own and where it's stored.

## Target User

Individuals who:
- Own multiple items across one or more homes
- Struggle to remember where they've stored belongings
- Want to avoid purchasing duplicate items
- Desire better organization of their possessions

## Core Features

### 1. Home Management

**Onboarding Flow**
- Users set up their first home during initial app launch
- Homes require only a name to create
- Homes are persistent and rarely changed after setup

**Home Functionality**
- Support for multiple homes per user
- Each home contains its own set of storage locations
- Homes serve as the top-level organizational unit

### 2. Storage Location System

**Hierarchical Structure**
- Storage locations belong to a specific home
- Locations can be nested within other locations (unlimited depth)
- Example hierarchy: Home → Bedroom → Under Bed → Briefcase

**Management Rules**
- Storage locations are tied to their home and cannot be moved between homes
- Storage locations cannot be deleted if they contain items
- Users must empty a location before deletion
- Nested locations can contain both items and other locations

### 3. Inventory Items

**Item Properties**
- Title (required)
- Description (optional)
- Photo (optional)
- Storage location (required)

**Item Capabilities**
- Items can be moved between storage locations
- Duplicate items are allowed in different locations
- Items can be deleted from inventory

### 4. Primary Interface

**Home View (Main Tab)**
- Displays all storage locations for the selected home
- Collapsible/expandable nested location structure
- Shows items within each location
- Visual hierarchy clearly indicates nesting levels

**Add Item Flow (Tab Bar Action)**
- Accessible via prominent button in tab bar
- Form-based interface with fields for:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Storage location selection or creation
  - Photo capture/selection option
- Quick save to inventory

### 5. Search & Discovery

**Global Search**
- Search across all homes and storage locations
