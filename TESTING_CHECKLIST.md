## 🧪 Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Nested Locations
1. Launch the app
2. Complete onboarding (if first time)
3. Create root location "Bedroom"
4. Tap on "Bedroom" or swipe for actions
5. Add nested location "Closet"
6. Verify "Closet" appears under "Bedroom" with indentation
7. Add "Top Shelf" under "Closet"
8. Verify hierarchy: Bedroom > Closet > Top Shelf

### Test 2: Undo Functionality
1. Create an item with a photo
2. Delete the item
3. Verify orange "Undo" button appears at top
4. Tap undo button
5. Verify item is restored with photo intact

### Test 3: Validation
1. Try creating location with empty name - should fail
2. Try creating duplicate location name at same level - should fail
3. Try creating very long names (>100 chars) - should fail
4. Try nesting beyond 10 levels - should fail

### Test 4: Search
1. Create multiple items in different locations
2. Use search pill to search
3. Filter by home (if multiple homes)
4. Verify results show location paths

### Test 5: Performance
1. Create 20+ locations with nesting
2. Add 50+ items with photos
3. Verify smooth scrolling
4. Verify fast search response
