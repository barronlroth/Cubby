# Cubby Implementation Todo List

## Overview
This todo list is derived from the technical specification and breaks down all implementation tasks into checkable items. Each epic is organized with its subtasks and estimated hours.

## Current Status for Handoff
**Last Updated:** August 16, 2025
**Developer:** Previous Dev
**Status:** Core features implemented, nested locations has a bug

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES FOR NEXT DEVELOPER
1. **Nested Locations Not Working Properly**
   - Parent-child relationships in SwiftData not persisting correctly
   - Locations can be created but don't show up in the hierarchy
   - Possible issue with the bidirectional relationship configuration
   - Check StorageLocation.swift lines 14-17 for relationship definitions

### Files to Review First
1. `/Cubby/Models/StorageLocation.swift` - Check relationship definitions
2. `/Cubby/Views/Home/AddLocationView.swift` - Location creation logic
3. `/Cubby/Views/Home/StorageLocationRow.swift` - Hierarchy display
4. `/Cubby/CubbyApp.swift` - ModelContainer setup
